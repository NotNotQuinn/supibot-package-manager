This command uses the following config variables:

- `LOCAL_PLAY_SOUNDS_PORT` - **NOT** setup by the setup script.
- `LOCAL_IP` - **NOT** setup by the setup script.

These seem to be specific to supi's setup, and if you want to 
know what to put in these variables, you may suggest to update 
them through the suggest command as supi did not write this.
