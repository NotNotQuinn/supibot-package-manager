This command uses the following config variables:

- `API_GOOGLE_YOUTUBE` - **NOT** setup by the setup script.
  - It is unclear what specificaly this config holds. If you 
    want more information, I would recommend suggesting to 
    update the docs for this command.

This commmand also is specificaly for supi's gachi database. 
I dont think anyone would want to replicate that xD
